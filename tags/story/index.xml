      <description>And we are back. It has been 2 years, a lot has changed, except for my generative art skills. Still learning the ropes. I started looking into attractors but got distracted and rather started watching The Coding Train&amp;rsquo;s Gravitational Force video.
I prepared a similar setup, and the idea was to add a lot of objects and see if it produces anything interesting. No dice.
Of course, just because there is a lot of flying stuff doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo;, I said to myself.</description>

      <description>One can always find a shimmer of order in chaos. And order without chaos is a fallacy.
I started with generative art by matt pearson and the first lesson was about creating lines on your own, add some variance and noise.
This gave me the idea to create a line with jitter effect. To do so, I had to take a trip down 10th standard maths lane and remind myself equations of lines, parallel lines, perpendicular lines, equation of a circle and its parametric form.</description>
