      <description>One can always find a shimmer of order in chaos. And order without chaos is a fallacy.
I started with generative art by matt pearson and the first lesson was about creating lines on your own, add some variance and noise.
This gave me the idea to create a line with jitter effect. To do so, I had to take a trip down 10th standard maths lane and remind myself equations of lines, parallel lines, perpendicular lines, equation of a circle and its parametric form.</description>
